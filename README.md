# Robust-Federated-Learning

For federated training undef different number of attackers, look at `main.py`

For federated training under different scale of omniscient attack, look at `omniscience-scale.py`

For generating gradients for aggregation model, look at `model_generation.py`

For training an aggregation model, look at `train_pointNet.ipynb`
